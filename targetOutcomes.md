# Target Outcomes
## Article ID: EXT_10-7-2015

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Study 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Because we were interested in generalizing about the characteristics of the targets (e.g., how perceptions of their trustworthiness relate to their sentences), we analyzed the data with the target as the unit of analysis. We therefore averaged the participants’ ratings to compute mean consensus judgments for each face on each trait. Degrees of freedom thus reflect the number of faces, rather than the number of participants contributing to judgments of those faces. Mean analyses. To investigate whether trustworthiness differed according to sentence and target race, we first subjected the mean trustworthiness data for each of the 742 targets to a 2 (race: Black vs. White) × 2 (sentence: life vs. death) between-targets analysis of variance (ANOVA). We observed a main effect of sentence, F(1, 738) = 7.44, p < .01, ηp2 = .01; targets sentenced to death looked less trustworthy (M = 2.76, SE = 0.03) than targets sentenced to life imprisonment (M = 2.87, SE = 0.03), 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference = [0.03, 0.20]. We also observed an unpredicted main effect of race, F(1, 738) = 47.67, p < .001, ηp2 = .06; Black targets were rated as more trustworthy (M = 2.96, SE = 0.03) than White targets (M = 2.67, SE = 0.03), 95% CI for the difference = [0.21, 0.37] (see the Supplemental Material available online for further discussion). Notably, race and sentence did not interact, F(1, 738) = 0.02, p > .88, ηp2 < .001, which suggests that the relationship between trustworthiness and sentence was not moderated by target race. For this reason, we did not compute an interaction term involving race for the subsequent regression analyses.
